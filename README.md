This is a Python script that performs a flood attack on a website using multiple threads. The attack is conducted by sending multiple HTTP requests to the target site. The script allows you to set the target URL and the number of threads to be used for the attack.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can install it using Termux with the following command:

```bash
pkg install python
```

## Installation

```bash
pkg install git
git clone https://github.com/fezarosa-dev/massattack.git
cd massattack
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Open Termux and navigate to the directory where the script is located:

```bash
cd /path/to/massattack
```

2. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python script.py
```

3. The script will prompt you for the target URL and the number of threads to use. Follow the on-screen instructions.

4. Enter the correct password when prompted (the password is "1919").

5. The attack will start, and you will see the progress of each thread in the terminal.

6. To stop the attack, press `Ctrl + C`.
